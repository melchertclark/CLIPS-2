Evergreen State University

## Variation Application Instructions
We're creating personalized recruitment emails for prospective students based on their academic performance, location, field of interest, and application status. Each variable affects how we position our offerings:

- GPA Range: Adjust messaging to reflect academic strengths and support systems
- Distance from Campus: Emphasize local connections or residential experiences based on distance
- Field of Interest: Highlight specific program features and outcomes
- Application Status: Provide appropriate next steps based on where they are in the process

For high GPA students, emphasize prestige, research, and advanced opportunities. For medium GPA students, focus on support systems and growth opportunities. For lower GPA students, highlight accessible entry points and success stories of students who improved.

Localize messaging based on proximity to campus - nearby students should hear about day visits and local events, while distant students should learn about virtual tours and residential life.

## Marker Instructions
- {{SUBJECT_LINE}}: Create an engaging, personalized subject line (30-60 characters) that references their field of interest and creates urgency appropriate to their application status.

- {{PERSONALIZED_INTRO}}: Write 1-2 sentences that connect their academic standing (GPA Range) with specific opportunities in their field of interest at our university.

- {{LOCATION_DETAIL}}: Based on the Distance variable, create 1-2 sentences about campus accessibility. For nearby students (<50 miles), mention easy commuting options. For mid-range distances, emphasize weekend visits. For distant students, highlight residential experiences and travel support.

- {{PROGRAM_HIGHLIGHT}}: Using the field of interest and associated data, craft 2-3 sentences highlighting the strongest aspects of the relevant academic program. Include specific faculty, facilities, or outcomes when available.

- {{CLUB_HIGHLIGHT}}: Describe 1-2 relevant student organizations related to their field of interest, using club data when available.

- {{APPLICATION_STATUS_MESSAGE}}: Provide appropriate next steps based on application status. For "Not Started," offer an application link and deadline. For "In Progress," encourage completion with a deadline reminder. For "Submitted," acknowledge receipt and provide timeline. For "Accepted," congratulate and offer enrollment steps.

## Tone & Style Prompts
Maintain a warm, encouraging tone throughout all variations. Use conversational language that's professional but not stuffy. Avoid generic promises - be specific and concrete about what sets us apart.

For high-achieving students, be more formal and academically focused. For others, be more supportive and growth-oriented.

Keep paragraphs short and scannable. Use active voice and direct address ("you" language).

Avoid clichÃ©s about "following your passion" or "changing the world" - instead, provide tangible examples of how students in these programs succeed.
